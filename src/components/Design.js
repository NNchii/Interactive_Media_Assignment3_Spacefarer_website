            <h2>Dev Blog week 3:</h2>
            <p>Coming back after the holidays I am definitely struggling slightly getting back into working with Javascript as I never really had a solid grasp of it by the end of last year, however I am excited into working more with it with react this year as both a new concept as well as expand my knowledge on JS more as it is still one of the newer languages to me. My impression on net/web art is definitely one of confusion which did not alleviate after looking through some examples of it. My main question is what exactly constitutes net/web art as the examples are very diverse from the way they are presented to how the viewer can interact with them. However the confusion only raises my interest in net/web art as I’d like to understand more about them and how they are created as I have seen what I’d think counts as net/web arts in the past and their unconventional ways to create and deliver an idea/message have always captivated the younger me.</p>
            <p>Net/web art often uses the internet as its primary medium which allows for interactive and dynamic experiences. This can include everything from web-based installations to virtual reality experiences as the internet makes it possible for artists to reach a global audience and create shared experiences for viewers everywhere. Another cool thing about net/web art is how it turns viewers into active participants instead of just looking at the art, people can interact with it thus making them a part of the piece which adds a whole new layer to the experience.</p>

            <p>Working with react is familiar yet also foreign to me, it took a little bit for me to build the testing-app and learning how to work with it and understanding the structure of react. Outside of coding, my research into net art only made me even more confused than before.Looking through several examples I find myself not understanding their messages and often even not understanding how to interact with the net art at all. I find myself looking at the titles of the artworks that would catch my attention, but the moment I open them, I find myself lost at what I’m supposed to be looking at or even how to use it exactly.</p>
            <p>One of them caught my interest being “My Boyfriend Came Back From The War'' (MBCBFTW) by the Russian artist Olia Lialina in 1996. I can somewhat understand the message the artwork is trying to convey through its distorted or even uncanny display of images and texts which often reminds me of uncanny videos I have seen on youtube before. The theme of trauma after war is also another interest of mine which is also especially relevant with the current events. </p>
            <p>Overall, delving into net art has been a journey of discovery as I had never imagined some of the net arts I have seen could be possible, MBCDFTW gave a unique aesthetic that had captured my interest and I’d like to look into it further to learn more about it and fully understand its unique way of storytelling using only html, especially being at the infancy of the internet.</p>

            <h2>Dev Blog week 12:</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately I have been stressed and overwhelmed with assignments for other courses lately which has made me fall significantly behind on my website development and I’m still struggling somewhat with JS and using React to create a full website. I am also unsure if I’d like to stick with my current website theme and design as I’m finding trouble making a website that can capture the envisioned feeling I wanted for a space/space exploration website, but different enough from the NASA website we had made last year. However I’m unsure what I could change it to or if I have enough time to revamp my current design. For my planning for my net art, progress has been slow as well. The concept I have in mind is to create a space exploration net art where the viewer could explore the infinite stars among the cosmos. I envision an interactive experience that allows users to navigate through different star systems, each with its own unique story or message. This idea aligns well with my current space theme and has the potential to be visually stunning and engaging.</p>
            <p>However, I'm unsure how to go about executing this idea as I still struggle with working with JavaScript. The technical challenges of creating an interactive and immersive net art piece are significant, and my confidence in my coding skills is not where it needs to be. Despite these hurdles, I'm determined to push through and find a way to bring my vision to life. Perhaps with some more research and practice, I can develop the skills needed to create an impactful and memorable piece of net art.</p>
